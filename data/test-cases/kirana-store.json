      "reasoning": "Indore families shop on weekends (Saturday 60%+ footfall). Product demos (FMCG brands pay ₹5K-8K per demo) + weekend combo offers drive impulse purchases. Festival pre-promotion (2 weeks before Diwali, Navratri) captures early buying. Loyalty points (1 point = ₹1 on ₹100 spend) drive 50-60% repeat rate. Alternative everyday low pricing competes with DMart/Reliance without differentiation."
